# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL-and-Power-BI
The project aimed to solve a two-fold business challenge. First, meeting KPIs requirements such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizza Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas per Order. Second, uncovering deeper insights including daily and monthly sales trends, percentage breakdown by category and size, total pizzas sold by category, and identifying top and bottom-performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and orders.

## Task:
The goal was to analyze pizza sales data to extract actionable insights that could optimize sales strategies, improve product placement, and enhance customer engagement.

## Data Preparation and Analysis:
Utilized SQL for analyzing data to calculate metrics and derive insights.
Designed queries to generate KPIs and identify trends by date, category, and size.

## Visualization Development:
Built an interactive and dynamic dashboard in Power BI to showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights.
Created charts and visuals to highlight daily/monthly trends, category-wise sales distribution, and product performance.

## Key Metrics Delivered:
Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizza Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas per Order were accurately calculated and visualized.

## Insights Uncovered:
Peak Sales:
Identified May, July, and August as the highest revenue-generating months.
Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays (weekends) recorded maximum sales.
Best-Selling Products:
Classic and Supreme pizzas accounted for 52% of sales.
