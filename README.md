# Integrated-Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL-and-Power-BI
This project demonstrates the integration of SQL for robust data querying and Power BI for dynamic visual analytics. The objective is to analyze a pizza sales dataset, uncover key business insights, and present them through interactive dashboards.The project highlights the synergy of database management and visualization tools to enable data-driven decision-making.

**Project Objectives:**
SQL Querying for Business Metrics:

Perform detailed analysis of pizza sales using structured SQL queries.
Extract meaningful insights such as total revenue, average order value, and customer behavior patterns.

**Dynamic Dashboards in Power BI:**

Build a visual representation of the data for better comprehension of business trends.
Create interactive dashboards for stakeholders to explore key performance indicators (KPIs).

**SQL Analysis:**
The project uses SQL to perform data analysis tasks, which include but are not limited to:

Total Revenue:
Calculate the overall revenue from all sales transactions.

Average Order Value (AOV):
Compute the average revenue per order, providing insights into customer spending behavior.

Total Pizzas Sold:
Aggregate the total number of pizzas sold, giving an understanding of product demand.

Total Orders Placed:
Count the number of unique orders, indicating the transaction volume.

Average Pizzas Per Order:
Estimate the average quantity of pizzas purchased per transaction to analyze customer purchasing habits.

**Power BI Dashboards:**
The Power BI file integrates these SQL analyses to create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that features:

Sales Overview Dashboard:

KPIs: Total revenue, total pizzas sold, and total orders
Trends: Monthly or daily revenue and order volume trends.
